TODO:
* Lock the framerate, that way the game speed is the same for different devices
* Sometimes the game loads before the player sprite is loaded, resulting in an error and a blank screen.
* add mobile controls (buttons for left/right rotate and thrust. maybe a slider for zoomFactor)
* add gravity to planets that impact player movement
* add collision between planets and player
* add some kind of procedurally generated cosmetic detail to planets
* a smaller view mode where you can 'enter' a planet and explore individual planets in depth
